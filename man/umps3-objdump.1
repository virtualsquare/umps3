.SH NAME
\f[CB]umps3\-objdump\f[R] \[en] The umps3\-objdump object file analysis
utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[CB]umps3\-objdump\f[R] [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]] \f[I]FILE\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The command\-line \f[CB]umps3\-objdump\f[R] utility is used to analyze
object files created by the \f[CB]umps3\-elf2umps\f[R] utility.
.PP
This utility performs the same functions as
\f[CB]mipsel\-linux\-gnu\-objdump\f[R] (or
\f[CB]mips\-linux\-gnu\-objdump\f[R]) which is included in the
cross\-platform development tool set.
.PP
\f[CB]umps3\-objdump\f[R] is used to analyze \f[CB].core\f[R],
\f[CB].rom\f[R], and \f[CB].aout\f[R] object files while
\f[CB]mipsel\-linux\-gnu\-objdump\f[R] is used to analyze ELF\-formatted
object files.
.PP
The output from \f[CB]umps3\-objdump\f[R] is directed to stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[CB]\-h\f[R]
Optional flag to show the \f[CB].aout\f[R] program header, if present.
.TP
\f[CB]\-d\f[R]
Optional flag to \[lq]disassemble\[rq] and display the \f[CB].text\f[R]
area in \f[I]FILE\f[R].
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.TP
\f[CB]\f[R]
This is an \[lq]assembly\[rq] dump of the code, thus it will contain
load and branch delay slots; differing from the machine language version
of the same code.
.TP
\f[CB]\-x\f[R]
Optional flag to produce a complete little\-endian format hexadecimal
word dump of \f[I]FILE\f[R].
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.TP
\f[CB]\f[R]
Zero\-filled blocks will be skipped and marked with *asterisks*.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.TP
\f[CB]\f[R]
The output will appear identical regardless of whether \f[I]FILE\f[R] is
little\-endian or big\-endian.
.TP
\f[CB]\-b\f[R]
Optional flag to produce a complete byte dump of \f[I]FILE\f[R].
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.TP
\f[CB]\f[R]
Zero\-filled blocks will be skipped and marked with *asterisks*.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.TP
\f[CB]\f[R]
Unlike with the \f[I]\-x\f[R] flag, the endian\-format of the output
will depend on the endianness of \f[I]FILE\f[R]; i.e.\ if \f[I]FILE\f[R]
is big\-endian than the output will be big\-endian.
.TP
\f[CB]\-a\f[R]
Flag to perform all of the above optional operations.
.SH FILES
\f[I]FILE\f[R] is the \f[CB].core\f[R], \f[CB].rom\f[R], or
\f[CB].aout\f[R] object file to be analyzed.
