.SH DESCRIPTION
The command\-line \f[CB]umps3\-elf2umps\f[R] utility is used to convert
the ELF formatted executable and object files produced by the gcc
cross\-platform development tools into the \f[CB].aout\f[R],
\f[CB].core\f[R], and \f[CB].rom\f[R] formatted files required by
\f[CB]uMPS3\f[R].
.PP
A successful conversion will produce a file by the name of
\f[CB]file.core.umps\f[R], \f[CB]file.rom.umps\f[R], or
\f[CB]file.aout.umps\f[R] accordingly.
.PP
A \f[CB].stab\f[R] file is a text file containing a one\-line
uMPS3\-specific header and the contents of the symbol table from the
ELF\-formatted input file.
It is used by the uMPS3 simulator to map \f[CB].text\f[R] and
\f[CB].data\f[R] locations to their symbolic, i.e.\ kernel/OS source
code, names.
Hence the automatic generation of the \f[CB].stab\f[R] file whenever a
\f[CB].core\f[R] file is produced.
Since \f[CB].stab\f[R] files are text files one can also examine/modify
them using traditional text\-processing tools.
.PP
In addition to its utility in tracking down errors in the
\f[CB]umps3\-elf2umps\f[R] program (which hopefully no longer exist),
the \f[I]\-v\f[R] flag is of general interest since it illustrates which
ELF sections were found and produced and the resulting header data for
\f[CB].core\f[R] and \f[CB].aout\f[R] files.
For \f[CB].rom\f[R] files, the \f[I]\-v\f[R] flag also displays the BIOS
code size obtained during file conversion.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[CB]\-v\f[R]
Optional flag to produce verbose output during the conversion process.
.TP
\f[CB]\-m\f[R]
Optional flag to generate the \f[CB].stab\f[R] symbol table map file
associated with \f[I]FILE\f[R].
.TP
\f[CB]\-k\f[R]
Flag to produce a \f[CB].core\f[R] formatted file.
This flag can only be used with an executable file.
A \f[CB].stab\f[R] file is automatically produced with this option.
.TP
\f[CB]\-b\f[R]
Flag to produce a \f[CB].rom\f[R] formatted file.
This flag can only be used with an object file that does not contain
relocations.
.TP
\f[CB]\-a\f[R]
Flag to produce a \f[CB].aout\f[R] formatted file.
