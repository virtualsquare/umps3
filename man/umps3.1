.SH NAME
\f[CB]umps3\f[R] \[en] Virtual machine simulator based around the MIPS
R2/3000 microprocessor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[CB]umps3\f[R] [\f[I]CONFIGURATION\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CB]uMPS\f[R] is an educational computer system architecture and an
accompanying emulator designed from the ground up to achieve the right
trade\-off between simplicity and elegance on one side, and realism on
the other.
This makes \f[CB]uMPS\f[R] ideally suited for use in education, such as
hands\-on operating systems or computer architecture university courses.
.PP
The uMPS processor implements the MIPS I instruction set, and can
therefore be supported out of the box by existing MIPS compilers.
The architecture details a complete set of I/O devices (terminals,
disks, flash devices, printers, and network adapters) that feature a
clean, consistent, programming interface.
The previous revision of the uMPS architecture (uMPS2) brings
multiprocessor support.
.PP
The emulator comes with built\-in debugging features and an easy to use
graphical user interface.
Apart from the emulator itself, several support utilities are provided
that can get you quickly started in developing programs for
\f[CB]uMPS\f[R].
